# ♛ Duchess — The Ultimate Chess Application

Duchess is a from-scratch chess engine and desktop application aiming for superhuman strength, a polished analytical GUI, and deep data integration. The engine is written in **C++** and communicates via the **UCI protocol**; the GUI is built with **Python / PyQt6**.

### 🔧 Next up

- Lichess API game importer (Phase 6.4)
- Smart time management (allocate more time in complex positions)

## Roadmap to beating Queen

The current goal is to surpass Queen (the benchmark opponent engine). Progress is tracked via gauntlet matches.

### Search (done)

All standard alpha-beta improvements are implemented: aspiration windows, check extensions, IID, singular extensions, null move pruning, LMR/PVS, reverse futility pruning, futility pruning, late move pruning, SEE-based ordering and capture pruning, countermove heuristic, killer moves, history heuristic.

### Classical Evaluation (done)

Rich handcrafted eval used standalone and blended 50/50 with NNUE: passed/doubled/isolated pawn detection, bishop pair bonus, rook on open/semi-open files, piece mobility (knights, bishops, rooks, queens), king safety via pawn shield, and game phase tapering between separate middlegame and endgame piece-square tables.

### NNUE Training (in progress)

The RL loop (`rl_loop.py`) automates iterative self-play training with Polyglot opening book support, Syzygy tablebases, and gauntlet matches against an external engine. Architecture: HalfKP 41024→256→128→128→1.

Each iteration:
1. **Self-play** — engine plays itself at depth 3 (10,000 games), capturing positions and scores directly via `engine.analyse()` — no re-evaluation pass needed
2. **Gauntlet** — optional match against an external engine (Queen405x64) for diagnostic purposes
3. **Distillation mix** — 500,000 positions streamed from the [Lichess eval DB](https://database.lichess.org/#evals) are mixed into the training set, anchoring label quality with cloud-depth evaluations
4. **Train** — PyTorch training on combined dataset, resuming from the previous checkpoint
5. **Export** — converted to `.bin` for the C++ engine; auto-pushed to GitHub

Training loss per iteration is logged to `training_log.json`. Gauntlet results are tracked in `match_results.json`.

**Current progress vs Queen405x64 (depth 6):**

| Date | Iteration | W | D | L | Score | Elo diff |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-03-06 | 14 | 0 | 0 | 10 | 0.0% | — |
| 2026-03-07 | 24 | 2 | 1 | 37 | 6.2% | −470 |
| 2026-03-07 | 26 | 2 | 2 | 35 | 7.7% | −432 |
| 2026-03-07 | 31 | 1 | 4 | 35 | 7.5% | −436 |
| 2026-03-07 | 35 | 2 | 9 | 29 | **16.2%** | **−285** |

Git storage: only the latest `duchess_iter_N.bin` is kept in the repository (older weights and all `.pt`/`.jsonl` checkpoints are excluded after use).

### Remaining

| Priority | Feature | Expected impact |
|---|---|---|
| High | More RL iterations (35 done, targeting 50) | Network learns from more diverse positions |
| Medium | Smart time management | Better use of clock in timed games |

## Implementation roadmap

The full plan is organised into **three pillars** and **six phases**.

### Pillar 2 — The Interface (Professional GUI)

| Phase | Goal | Key features |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | Hardware-accelerated & reactive GUI | QGraphicsScene / OpenGL board, eval bar, PV arrows, threat heatmaps, multi-engine panel |

### Pillar 3 — Data & Ecosystem

| Phase | Goal | Key features |
|---|---|---|
| 6 | Deep data integration & cloud | Polyglot opening book, PGN database (PostgreSQL), repertoire builder, cloud sync API |

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** with PyQt6
- **CMake 3.16+** and a C++17 compiler
- **Git LFS** (for NNUE weights and training data)
- PostgreSQL (optional, for game database features)

### Quick setup (Ubuntu)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/damm89/duchess.git
cd duchess
bash setup_ubuntu.sh
```

This creates a `py-duchess` virtualenv, installs all dependencies, sets up PostgreSQL, and builds the engine.

### Manual setup

```bash
# Create virtualenv
python3 -m venv py-duchess
source py-duchess/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Build the engine
cd engine
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)
```

The resulting `duchess_cli` binary speaks UCI.

### Run the GUI

```bash
source py-duchess/bin/activate
python -m duchess.main
```

### Run tests

```bash
# Python tests
pytest tests/

# C++ engine tests (after building)
cd engine/build && ctest --output-on-failure
```
